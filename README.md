# Housing-Price-Regression-Testing
Testing the regression assumptions on parts of a house to see if prediction can be done. We test to see which parts of a house (Exterior, Interior, Premium features) can be used to predict housing price. The main purpose of this report is testing the regression assumptions. If the assumptions pass, then regression can be used as a methodolgy to infer prediction.

The following regression assumptions are checked for each subcategory of the house:
  1. Errors are pairwise independent, have constant variance and are normally distributed.
  2. Little to no multicollinearity
