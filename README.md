# Housing-Price-Regression-Testing
Testing the regression assumptions on parts of a house to see if prediction can be done.

The following regression assumptions are checked for each subcategory of the house:
  1. Errors are pairwise independent, have constant variance and are normally distributed.
  2. Little to no multicollinearity
